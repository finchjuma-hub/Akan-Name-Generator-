# Akan-Name-Generator-

## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a web application that allows users to discover their traditional Akan name.
In Ghana, Ivory Coast and Togo names are given based on the day of the week a child is born and their gender.
This project collects a user's birthdate and gender, validates the input, calculates the day of the week, and displays the correct Akan name.

Scenario 1: User enters a valid date and selects gender
            then inputs '14/01/2006' and selects 'Male'
            and submitts the form,
            the display will be:

            "You were born on Saturday."
            "Your Akan name is Kwame."

Scenario 2: User enters an invalid date 
            then inputs an impossible date (e.g. 34/01/2020)
            and the form is submitted
            the app will display:

            "Please enter a valid date."

Scenario 3: User does not select a gender
            the user leaves gender blank
            and the form is submitted
